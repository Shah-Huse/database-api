# database-api
REST API for MySQL

For Api documentation please refer to "Api Documentation.md"

After cloning the project, in order for the application to run you should override following parameters 
"MYSQL_URL", "MYSQL_USER", "MYSQL_PASS" in the "Run/Debug Configurations" of IDE.
Example: MYSQL_URL = localhost:3306/databaseName

It is required that MySQL Server is installed locally and is running.  
The project currently lacks necessary tests.
